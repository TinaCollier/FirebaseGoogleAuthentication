# FirebaseGoogleAuthentication
Login page with Firebase email/password and Google Authentication login

## What Is It?
For this MITxPro challenge, we were tasked with adding Google Authorization to a login form. We were provided the template and needed to add the necessary elements to set up Google Authentication.

## What I Found Challenging
I found setting up the popup to login with Google a bit confusing. I found the answer in the Firebase Docs and it worked great once I included it. 

## How Will I Use This In the Future
I am floored by how easy-to-use Firebase is. Authentication can be tricky and this service makes it much easier. The other aspects of Firebase's platform are very useful and effective as well. I will definitly be using Firebase in the future.
